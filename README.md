This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This is intended to be a quick demo showcasing how to validate ts-types at runtime, using ajv and ts-json-schema-generator. 
You should only have to work with typescript-types, ajv and ts-json-schema-generator generates types for you. 
The relevant files to look at are the following:
- types.ts
- types.validators.ts
- generate-json-schema.js
- app/page.tsx

  The first three define the functions that are then used in the page-component to validate the input. The type of what you fetch from the example-api can then go from `unknown` to `Query`.
  There are some build-problems that need to be solved to use this generally. 



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
